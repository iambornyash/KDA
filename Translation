Decision

The complainants filed this complaint on March 25, 2003, 
against the opposite party, alleging that the opposite party's department, 
through a lottery system, had allotted LIG (Low Income Group) houses in Sector-8, Kanpur, 
as follows: Complainant No. 1 was allotted house No. D-225, Complainant No. 2 was allotted D-409, Complainant No. 3 was allotted D-530, 
Complainant No. 4 was allotted D-430, Complainant No. 5 was allotted C-64, Complainant No. 6 was allotted D-336, and Complainant No. 7 was allotted C-127. 
The complainants were making installment payments for these houses and were requesting the opposite party to register the said properties in their names.

(2)
The complainants repeatedly contacted the opposite party to register the said houses, 
but the opposite party demanded payment at the rate of Rs. 1600/- per square meter and 
verbally informed them that the building allotments would be cancelled. 
This amount is excessively high based on the terms of the allotment. 
The complainants are ready to deposit the outstanding amount for the houses, 
along with late fees and applicable interest, with the opposite party's department. 
However, the opposite party insists on registering the houses only at the rate of Rs. 1600/- per square meter, 
which constitutes a gross deficiency in service. Therefore, the complainants have filed this complaint, 
seeking relief in the form of permission to deposit the amount as per the agreement made at the time of house allotment, 
so that they can make the payment and the registration of the said houses can be completed.

The Opponent has stated in its counter-claim that the complainants no. 1 to 7 were allotted houses for the low-income group by the opposite party, 
but the complainants have been negligent in depositing the installments for the houses in question as per the agreement.
This was communicated by the opposite party through registered post on 11.7.96, 21.8.01, and 23.1.02. 
In addition, a form was sent on 21.6.01 under the one-time settlement scheme issued by the Government of Uttar Pradesh, 
but the complainants paid no attention to it, nor did they deposit any money. 
The allotted houses were cancelled by the Vice Chairman of the KDA (Kanpur Development Authority) on 7.1.02.
The complainants prayed for the restoration of the cancellation of the houses in question, 
which the opposite party, adopting a humane approach, revoked the cancellation order and directed them to deposit the money. 
However, the complainants still did not deposit a single penny and filed the complaint before the forum, which is contrary to the facts presented. 
There was no deficiency in service. The complaint is liable to be dismissed.
The parties filed their affidavits/counter-affidavits and relevant documentary evidence in support of their complaint/written statement/ reply.

The arguments of the parties were heard and all the evidence available on the file was examined.

Upon perusal of the evidence available in the case file, the affidavits, and the arguments of the learned advocates for the parties, it is concluded that the complainants were allotted the houses which is in question through a lottery in ward 8, 
under the low-income group category.  
The houses had an area of ​​42.19 square meters, and the price was Rs. 400/- per square meter, making the total cost Rs. 16876/-.  
Including interest, the amount payable to the opposite party over 10 years was Rs. 24706/-.  
In which the complainant No. 1 deposited the following amounts: Rs. 19800/- for building No. D.225 up to June 6, 2000; Rs. 20744/- for building No. D.409 up to August 20, 1997; Rs. 9962/- for building No. D.530 up to April 18, 2006; Rs. 22962/- for building No. D.430 up to November 13, 2000; Rs. 10589/- for building No. C.64 up to May 2, 2006; Rs. 12508/- for building No. D.366 up to October 12, 2008; and Rs. 8195/- for building No. C.127 up to December 13, 1995. 
This is clearly substantiated by the documentary evidence on record.

The opposing party argues that there was negligence in depositing the installments for the houses in question, and that the complainants were informed of this via registered post on July 11, 1996, August 21, 2001, and January 23, 2002. 
However, the complainants did not pay the required amount for the buildings. 
Their application for the houses was cancelled, and they subsequently submitted a request for reinstatement. 
On humanitarian grounds, the cancellation of the said houses was revoked, but the opposing party did not specify the rate at which the complainants were required to deposit the money for the buildings. 
The complainants have also stated in their affidavit that the opposing department demanded payment at the rate of ₹1600 per square meter. 
By not mentioning the actual rate, the opposition has attempted to portray a reduction in services.

Page No 21

(3)

According to the agreement made at the time of allotment, they wanted to pay the amount including the late payment charges and the interest due thereon, 
which they have clearly mentioned in paragraph 6 of their reply. 
The opposite party harassed the complainants by adopting unnecessary and illegal procedures, even though the opposite party had reinstated the cancellation. 
Demanding an amount contrary to the rate stipulated in the agreement at the time of allotment, after reinstating the cancellation of the allotment, constitutes a deficiency in service. 
from a legal standpoint. 
The opposite party cannot demand an amount at a rate higher than the rate stipulated in the allotment agreement. 
In the interest of justice, the complainants' complaint is admissible.

Order
The complainants' petition is accepted. The respondent is
ordered to execute the registration within 30 days of this
order, adjusting the deposited amount according to the
prevailing rate at the time of allotment of the properties in
question. Failure to do so will result in simple interest at
18 percent per annum being payable on the entire deposited
amount until the date of execution.
